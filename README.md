# SudokuChallenge

I was challenged to make a simple sudoku game as a test. There are no preset patterns. 
The player may place any number in any square, as long as it adheres the rules of sudoku.

Rules:
1. Every vertical and horizontal row has to contain one of each digit 1-9
2. The 9x9 board is split into nine 3x3 boards, they also each must contain only one of each digit 1-9

The player must solve the puzzle by completing the board. Pressing the digit on the keyboard one to nine and clicking on the tile will insert the number. The game will stop you from placing your tile if it would break the rules, you win if you fill the board.
